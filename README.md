# Terms and Conditions Formatter

Terms at times can be given in different formats: e.g 1. 2) as we are not aware which format will be given to us, to transform a text terms & conditions file into a html format we can wrap paragraph tags around it.

This tool works by adding the text to the left textarea and the results will be seen real time on the textarea to your right.
This was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
